#### [Web application link](https://hmlea.shinyapps.io/kinetics/)

**Kinetics** is a web application that performs different enzymatic calculations and creates simple and effective plots. The application allows the calculation of rate from absorbance data and the generation of Michaelis-Menten plots from substrate concentration and rate data. The plots created by **Kinetics** can be exported as PNG images of any given size and can be used freely by you.

## Usage

This web application has two main features: it allows for the calculation of enzyme rates and solves for and plots the Michaelis-Menten equation. The **Kinetics** web app can be accessed [here](https://hmlea.shinyapps.io/kinetics/) or you can download and run it on your machine using the Shiny package with the following code:

    `shiny::runGitHub("hmlea/kinetics")`
    
### Rates

The rates feature of the app allows you to upload one or more CSV files containing absorbance vs. time data. Any number of spreadsheets can be uploaded at once but they must have time in the first column and absorbance in the second column.

Once uploaded, each spreadsheet will be plotted and you will be prompted to click on each plot twice. For the first click, click on the baseline concentration; for the second click, click on peak immediately after the substrate is added and concentration starts to decrease. Try to choose points with as little noise as possible and are closest to what the true concentration might be. Also, note that it doesn't matter what y value you click on; the application only takes into consideration the x coordinate. See below for an example of where to click.

After clicking through all the plots, a table below the plot window will populate with the calculated rates. Make sure to click through each plot before uploading more spreadsheets. All the plots can be downloaded as a zip file with the "Download Plots" button and can be exported with or without the linear regression used to find the rate. The title of each plot contains the name of the file uploaded, and the time used to calculate the linear regression.

### Michaelis-Menten

The other feature of the app generates Michaelis-Menten plots from substrate concentration and rate data. You must upload a single spreadsheet that contains this data, with substrate concentration in the first column and rate in the second column. This data is plotted and a Michaelis-Menten curve is fit and added to the graph. Doing this solves for the V~max~ and K~M~ which is plotted alongside the curve in the top right hand corner of the plot. This plot can also be downloaded as an image with the "Download Plot" button.

## To Do

In the future, I would like to:

-   Allow the customization of more basic plot features
-   Add the ability to overlay multiple Michaelis-Menten plots
-   Rework the download button and add the ability to lock the aspect ratio
-   Allow for certain plot features to be selectively hidden or shown
-   Expand and enhance the upload spreadsheet functionality
-   Add an advanced features option that allows more customization
-   Add visual cue when the plot is clicked
